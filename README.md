This repository was created for the class "Computer Programming for Engineers" at NYU Abu Dhabi. 
It contains C# scripts and a video walkthrough of the final project "Xplora".
#CONCEPT:
"Xplora" is a VR museum simulation made of 3 floor with a quiz game. Each floor has a specific theme and contains interesting assets with their information.
Xplora starts with a main menu:

The user is able to choose which floor to start with from the 3 floors.
According to their choice, they will be directed to the corresponding floor.


##FLOOR 1: RENAISSANCE ART
This floor has a collection of Renaissance paintings with their information. A soothing music is playing in the background for more immersion.

##FLOOR 2: ANCIENT/SCULPTURES
The second floor of Xplora is a different world. Here, the user discovers artifacts from different eras and places, with different stories as well.
The user is also greeted by an animated host at the entrance.

##FLOOR 3: CONTEMPRARY ART
The third floor of Xplora presents contemprary works. Discover a beautiful collection of contemprary art pieces in this floor, alongside a calming music while you're discovering the floor.



##QUIZ TIME:
For the sake of keeping the engagement of the users and having a fun/interactive/informative part in the project, a quiz game was implemented. The user is asked to answer a few questions on some information they read in the art pieces' descriptions. There'sa right and wrong answer!

##YOU CAN ALWAYS GO BACK;
A pause menu was implemented not to oblige our users to turn off the HMD in order to stop the simulation. You can easily pause/restart/quit the game using the pause menu
