This repository was created for the class "Computer Programming for Engineers" at NYU Abu Dhabi. 
It contains C# scripts and a video walkthrough of the final project "Xplora".
"Xplora" is a VR museum simulation made of 3 floor with a quiz game. Each floor has a specific theme and contains interesting assets with their information.
Xplora starts with a main menu:

The user is able to choose which floor to start with from the 3 floors.
According to their choice, they will be directed to the corresponding floor.

FLOOR 2: ANCIENT/SCULPTURES
The second floor of Xplora is a different world. Here, the user discovers artifacts from different eras and places, with different stories as well.
The user is also greeted by an animated host at the entrance.

QUIZ TIME:
For the sake of keeping the engagement of the users and having a fun/interactive/informative part in the project, a quiz game was implemented. The user is asked to answer a few questions on some information they read in the art pieces' descriptions. There'sa right and wrong answer!

YOU CAN ALWAYS GO BACK;
A pause menu was implemented not to oblige our users to turn off the HMD in order to stop the simulation. You can easily pause/restart/quit the game using the pause menu
